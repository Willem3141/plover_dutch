My Dutch steno theory and dictionary

## Vowels
```
a            = A
aa           = AE
au           = AU
e            = E
ee           = AEU
ei, ij, aai  = AOEU
    - conflict -> ei, aai = AO*EU
eu, etc.     = AO
i            = EU
ie           = AOE
o            = O
oe           = AOU
oi, ooi, ui  = OEU
oo           = OE
u, uu        = U
```

## Initial consonants
```
sch, sh (shop)          = SH-
schr                    = SR-
j                       = SKWR- / KWR- (still need to decide??)
ch                      = KH-
g                       = TKPW-
vl                      = TPHR- (als fl)
vr                      = TPR- (als fr)
```

## Final consonants
```
ch, g                   = -G
ng, nk                  = -PBG
    - conflict -> nk = *PBG
pel                     = -PL
lp                      = ??
tie, sie                = -GS
```

### Plural ending

The `-en` verb or noun plural ending is stroked as `-Z` (`HAUDZ` = houden, `HAPBDZ` = handen), except for words ending on `-T` which get `-TS` (`KRAPBTS` = kranten).

To do: solve conflicts with words ending on -ds (Nederlands vs. Nederlanden).
